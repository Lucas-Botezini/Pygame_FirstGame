Hello Everyone,

This repository contains the first Pygame I made! 
This was made to present at school, so a hope you like it too,
and this game was made while watching/learning from the course "The ultimate introduction to Pygame" from "Clear Code",

In this repository there are 3 python files, one of them being the commented version, which I did while learning, so I let it full of comments so I could come back and see it again.

So I hope you like, it and thank you very much!
